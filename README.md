For my cs project i am supposed to sort data from a text file using heap sort. I am using an array implementation for heaps and
am having some trouble understanding the insert portion of heap.
In order to insert a value properly you must first insert it at the end of the array and then compare it to the parent.
Wouldn't that mean you may end up with blanks in the array?
